## TODO

- [ ] idioms for generating some dummy assemblage layers
- [ ] abbreviations and acronyms for parameters

## Construct building blocks

### Area

#### Create polygon

##### From coordinates

##### Of desired area

##### Read from shapefile

#### Specify visibility

##### From distribution

Distributions can be specified with a

##### From raster

##### As scalar

#### Creating many Areas




### Assemblage

<hr>

## Use cases

### Planning phase

#### What spatial units should I choose? Transects? Quadrats?


#### What transects/quadrats alignment and spacing should I use if I want to cover *X*% of the area?


#### How should I orient transects/quadrats?


#### What is the relationship between transect/quadrat spacing and time?


#### What is the relationship between transect/quadrat spacing and recovery rates?


#### What is the relationship between my coverage and artifact/feature density?


#### I have *N* surveyors. How long will it take them to carry out a given coverage?


#### How many surveyors do I need to carry out a given coverage in a given amount of time?


#### How closely does my survey sample match the underlying assemblage?


#### Does my coverage detect a certain kind of scatter/feature?


#### How does ground visibility impact recovery rates?


#### How does ground visibility impact survey time?


#### I have surveyors of different skill levels. How will that impact my recovery rates? How will it impact my time?


<hr>

### Analysis phase

#### My survey took *X* person/hours. How much time *should* it have taken?


#### If I had used a different coverage type, how would my recovery have differed?


#### If I had used a different coverage interval, how would my recovery have differed?
