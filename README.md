# Prospect

Prospect is a set of tools for simulating archaeological field surveys.

## TODO

- [ ] specify default values
  - [ ] track down estimates of survey speed
  - [ ] calculate time added by artifact recording in LEIA Project or elsewhere
- [ ] determine measures to calculate for any given simulation
- [ ] plan visualization methods
- [ ] create hypothetical experiments to derive parameters
- [ ] allow *any* scipy `rv_continuous` distribution to be used for parameters

## Discovery parameters

1. Surface visibility
    - beta distribution
    - If 10 artifacts were randomly placed in that area/unit, how many would be visible? Assume ideal observation rate and perfect skill
2. Ideal observation rate
    - beta distribution
    - If 10 artifacts of that type were in a survey unit, how many would be detected? Assume perfect visibility and a surveyor with top skill level
3. Proximity
4. Surveyor skill
    - beta distribution
    - If this surveyor encountered 10 artifacts, how many would they recognize and record? Assume perfect visibility and ideal observation rate

## Time parameters

1. Artifact/feature recording time penalty
2. Survey unit minimum time
3. Surveyor speed penalty

## One simulation run

Surface vis and ideal obs rate are already properties in the world, so those get defined first. Then, a feature has to intersect the coverage to be discoverable. Finally, the surveyor's skill is the last filter in the sequence.

- Assign surface visibility value to features (TODO: what to do for visibility of non-point features?)
- Ideal observation rate already attached to features
- Multiply last two steps together to get an environmental probability for all features

- Find all features that intersect a survey unit and set proximity probability to 1.0
- Note which features do not intersect any survey units and set proximity probability to 0.0

- Allocate surveyors according to strategy defined by `Team.assignment`
- For features that do intersect a survey unit, get a surveyor skill value and multiply that by environmental probability for final probability.

TODO for above steps

- Need table of


## Building blocks

Prospect is designed around a few simple building blocks that can be customized (or not) to whatever degree the user requires.

### `Simulation`


### `Survey`

A Survey is one complete set of building blocks. For some purposes, only one Survey will need to be created, but in most cases, multiple Surveys will need to be generated. For example, if you want to randomize the locations of artifacts/features between simulations, a new Survey will need to be created for each different set of .

### `Area`

The Area defines the spatial extent of the survey. Spatial aspects of the Assemblage and the SurveyStrategy are placed within the Area.

An Area can be defined with a simple rectangle or with more complex shapes from a shapefile.

The surface visibility parameter is set on the Area either as a distribution or with a pre-calculated surface.

The Area has attributes like min/max bounds and area (as in mÂ²).

### `Assemblage`

The Assemblage represents the artifacts or other features-of-interest in an Area. The Assemblage needs to be able to handle multiple inputs because archaeologists are often interested in identifying more than one type of artifact or feature in their survey. Prospect does this with Layers.

#### `Layers`

Each Layer of an Assemblage should be a homogeneous type of shape (e.g., points, lines, or polygons). The user can ask Prospect to place these shapes in various configurations (random, Poisson, Matern, etc.) with specified densities or, in a case where the survey has already taken place, the user can provide their own shapefile(s).

Each Layer is given a name that facilitates tracking and analysis through the simulation process.

The user can assign a time penalty to a Layer that represents the amount of time added to the minimum search time (see below) for each artifact or feature observed in that Layer. This is designed to account for the fact that stopping to record, mark, or collect artifacts or features slows down the survey process.

All Layers also have an ideal observation rate, which represents the frequency with which an artifact or feature will be recorded, assuming the following ideal conditions:

- It lies inside or intersects the Coverage (see below)
- Surface visibility is 100%
- The surveyor is highly skilled
  
These assumptions are important to consider further. The ideal observation rate is specified here solely as a property of the materials (i.e., artifacts or features) themselves, unrelated to the distance from the observer, surface visibility, or surveyor skill. These other factors are all accounted for in other parts of the simulation, so users should avoid replicating that uncertainty here. For *most* Layers, this value should probably be 1.0 or close to 1.0, but there are some scenarios where you might want to consider an alternate value. For instance:

- If the Layer represents extremely small artifacts (e.g., beads, tiny stone flakes) that are hard to observe even in the best conditions.
- If the Layer represents artifacts or features that are difficult to differentiate from the surface "background". For example, in a gravelly area, ceramic sherds can be difficult to differentiate from rocks. A major caveat here is that this "background noise" is sometimes considered in surface visibility estimations, so the user should take care not to duplicate that uncertainty if it is already accounted for in the simulation.

### `Coverage`

The Coverage is where the user defines how the survey will be set up. The user can define the shape of the survey unit (transects, radial, quadrat, checkerboard, etc.) and the intervals at which they'd like them to be spaced. Alternatively, they can specify the survey unit and the percent of the Area they'd like covered, and Prospect will generate a Coverage to fit.

The Coverage also defines how an artifact or feature's distance from the survey unit impacts whether or not it is discovered.

The user can also specify an estimated minimum search time for a single survey unit. This should be an estimate of the amount of time it would take the most skilled surveyor to search a survey unit where they encountered no artifacts or features.

For transects, the time should be specified in seconds per unit of transect length. For example, if it is estimated to take an expert surveyor 20 minutes to survey 400 meters given they didn't encounter any artifacts or features, the minimum search time would be specified as 3 seconds/meter (i.e., 1200 seconds / 400 meters). This factor is then applied to the actual transects to calculate an estimated minimum search time for each.

N.B. Humans' preferred walking speed is 1.4 m/sec () (source: Wikipedia)

This forms the baseline to which additional time is added. Time can be added for each artifact observed and/or based on the surveyor speed attribute (see below).
  
#### `Transects`

Transects are probably the most common type of coverage. They are represented in Prospect by lines. The user will also specify a buffer distance around the lines that represents the "sweep width". Artifacts or features within the sweep width are "eligible" to be observed in the survey. Whether they are *actually* observed depends on the suite of all factors like ideal observation rate, surface visibility, and surveyor skill.

#### `Radial`

Radial survey units are regularly-spaced circles of a given radius. The radius is equivalent to the "sweep width" of a transect.

#### `Quadrat`

Quadrats are similar to Radial survey units except they are usually quadrilaterals (mostly typically, squares).

#### `Checkerboard`

A Checkerboard pattern is a special kind of quadrat-based survey.

### `Team`

TODO: How to allocate surveyors across survey units? Proportionally? Randomly?

The Team represents the surveyors who will carry out the simulated survey. The user can specify a skill level and a speed penalty for each surveyor. The skill level impacts the probability that an artifact or feature will be recorded (lower skill = more missed artifacts). The speed penalty adds extra time to both the Coverage's minimum survey time and the Layer's time penalty.

In its most basic implementation, a Team would be made up of one surveyor with a skill level of 1.0 and a speed penalty of 0.0.

In some cases though, it may be more appropriate to include surveyors of different skill levels and speeds. One situation where the user may want to specify surveyors of various skill levels and speeds would be where there was a high degree of difference between the least and most skilled team members. In a field school context, for example, it is often the case that there are a small number of very experienced archaeologists (PIs, TAs, etc.) and a larger number of inexperienced archaeologists (field school students, new volunteers, etc.). In that case, it may not be reasonable to assume a uniform skill level and speed.
