`prospect` is a Python package to build and run simulations of archaeological surveys. It is designed to be a flexible tool that can be run with some sensible defaults or highly customized, depending on the userâ€™s needs.

Development was started by [Jacob Deppen](https://deppen8.github.io) as part of his Ph.D. research in the [Digital Archaeology Research Lab](https://www.digarlab.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington.

The source code for `prospect` (and these docs) is available at [github.com/deppen8/prospect](https://github.com/deppen8/prospect).

## How to use this guide

This user guide is intended to serve all users of the `prospect` package, from beginner to advanced.

This guide contains summaries and walkthroughs of `prospect`'s features, mixing text and code. Many of the pages are built from Jupyter notebooks and can be run in the cloud on MyBinder (the rocketship icon at the top of the page) or downloaded and run locally (download icon -> .ipynb).

The site also contains the full technical documentation for the `prospect` Python package under the **API DOCS** section.

This guide *does* assume some familiarity with Python syntax for things like importing external packages, assigning variables, calling functions, and common data types like strings, lists, dictionaries, `pandas` DataFrames and `numpy` arrays. However, it is my hope that users who are acquainted with similar languages like R should find a lot of familiar ground. When developing `prospect`, wherever possible, I tried to give preference to more common data structures and simpler syntax.
