This user guide is intended to serve all users of the `prospect` package, from beginner to advanced.

This guide *does* assume some familiarity with Python syntax for things like importing external packages, assigning variables, calling functions, and common data types like strings, lists, dictionaries, `pandas` DataFrames and `numpy` arrays. However, it is my hope that users who are acquainted with similar languages like R should find a lot of familiar ground. When developing `prospect`, wherever possible, I tried to give preference to more common data structures and simpler syntax.
